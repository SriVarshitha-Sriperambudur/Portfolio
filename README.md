## Featured Projects

### 🖐️ [Air Canvas: A Computer Vision-Based Drawing System with SVM-Powered ASL Recognition](https://github.com/SriVarshitha-Sriperambudur/Air-Canvas-A-Computer-Vision-Based-Drawing-System-with-SVM-Powered-ASL-Recognition)

**Draw in the air using your fingers!**
* Real-Time Hand Tracking: Implemented using MediaPipe and OpenCV to detect and track hand landmarks with high accuracy for interactive drawing.
* Gesture-Based Drawing Interface: Enabled intuitive control over brush, color palette, eraser, and shape tools — all operated through dynamic hand gestures.
* Sign Recognition with SVM: Trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify ASL-inspired hand signs, allowing users to draw predefined objects through recognized gestures.
* Smooth & Stable Output Rendering: Integrated Exponential Moving Average (EMA) filters to reduce jitter and provide a natural, fluid drawing experience.
